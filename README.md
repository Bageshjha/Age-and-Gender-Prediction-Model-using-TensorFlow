# Age-and-Gender-Prediction-Model-using-TensorFlow
This project is a deep learning-based model that predicts both age and gender from facial images using the UTKFace dataset. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras and TensorFlow libraries, and performs two tasks simultaneously:  Gender Classification (Male/Female) Age Regression
